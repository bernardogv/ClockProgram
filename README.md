# Clock Program

## Description
The Clock Program is a simple console application that simulates both 12-hour and 24-hour clocks. It serves as a useful tool for practicing time calculations and understanding time formats. This project was developed to meet the requirements of an assignment by Chada Tech, applying fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, input validation, and proper file organization.

## Features
- Display the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- A user-friendly interface to add time to the clocks.
- Robust input validation for user commands.
- Clear display formatting using asterisks to create borders.

## What Was Done Well
One of the strengths of this project is its clear and organized code structure. The use of object-oriented programming principles and input validation enhances the reliability of the application.

## Code Enhancement
To further improve the code, consider enhancing input validation to handle additional edge cases, ensuring the program remains robust in various scenarios.

## Challenging Code Portions
The most challenging aspect of the project was implementing input validation, especially for user commands. However, by leveraging online resources and seeking guidance from the programming community, I was able to overcome these challenges and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Transferable Skills
This project has equipped me with valuable skills in object-oriented programming, input validation, and project organization. These skills will undoubtedly prove beneficial in future projects and coursework.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To make this program maintainable, I adhered to consistent coding standards and provided detailed comments within the code. The use of separate source and header files, along with a well-defined file structure, contributes to the program's readability and adaptability, making it easier to extend and modify in the future.

## Usage
To run the Clock Program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the source code to an executable.
2. Run the executable in your command line or terminal.
3. Interact with the program through the displayed menu.

## File Structure
- src/ - Contains the source files for the application.
- include/ - Contains the header files for the application.
- src/obj/ - Contains the compiled object files.
